		<p>With the Corona virus on the loose Governments have been taking action both to stop the spread of the virus and sustain economic stability. The average citizen may be thinking about UBI without taking other factors into consideration. For example, less productivity, there may be less products on the shelf which means they wil be greater in demand. This "Government Stimulus" gives people money in the short run but also causes inflation.  These are just 2 factors that will cause the decline of the U.S. dollar. There are other factors such as a potentiol bubble in the real estate market. Oil is already down to $20 a barrel and it is true that the best time to buy is after a crash and during the bear market(not go back up for a few years). </p>
		<br>
		<p>However there are better investments during this time. Here's why, in 1971 the US dollar was taken off the gold standard and became "fiat currency". The word fiat is latin which means "let it be done" by personal authority. There is nothing backing it up and the central banks know this. During the civil war Greenbacks were issued and it was fiat currency. Before the civil war silver and gold were used as currency. So how did we get back on the gold standard before Richard Nixon went back to fiat currency? Do you see a pattern here? Monetary policy switches back between Gold standard and fiat and there are reasons why.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gold is very scarse, so if your dollar is backed by gold what happens when the people controlling the money decide to print more dollars, Inflation and now your dollar returns you less gold. Because of its scarcity it is very easy to manipulate. Now silver which is more plentiful is harder for them to manipulate. The only way to control it is by government issued coins(nickels,dimes, quarters) that can be used for taxes. King Henry the 8th did this using wooden sticks "tally sticks" which could be paid in taxes to fight the wealthy who tried to rule the thrown from behind the scenes. The US government has learned this, which is why we pay taxes with their currency whether it be fiat or gold & silver standard. </p>
		<br>
		<p>So we know how the financial institutions get a stranglehold on governments, which rule over us. Now lets talk about the other side, the everyday person who wants financial freedom because without it you have no freedom you are a slave. If silver was a currency there would be financial freedom, there's plenty of it and the only people who can inflate it are hard-working men who mine it. Silver is the ideal currency for personal financial freedom in a free country. The only problem, talked about earlier, are financial insituations that control a government which will tax the people with their 35% silver currency. If the collapse of the US dollar occurs, there may be a switch to the gold and silver standard, which many people have been tricked into beleiving is a good thing. If you invest your money in silver because it is great for future currency you may not profit in the end. Because you will have to pay taxes with their issued currency, instead of being able to pay your taxes with YOUR silver they will offer you a bad deal.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So we have discussed silver and the financial freedoms it can provide for the mojority of the populace. The main reason being it is out the central banks jurisdiction. Cryptocurrency is also out of their control, or is it? In early 20th century most people did not like bankers. So to get what they want they would act like they didn't want it, causing the public to think "if bankers don't want it, then it must be good" to get their way.  It was reverse psychology and we may be seeing that with Cryptocurrency. A good example is peter schiff, when the rothschild's were at the start of building their international banking empire they shared a mansion with the schiff family. He is or acts like he is very against cryptocurrency and praises gold and silver. He makes some good points such as future technologies that could be better but named no examples such as quantim computers. The 1907 bank panic caused distrust in local banks, allowing the central banks to consildate power and create the federal reserve.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The point I am trying to make is that these families which control monetary policy for governments may want to change that monetary policy again. Maybe they don't and want to continue fiat currency, but even they know that is unsustainable. Either way there are still ways to win in the future markets: Cryptocurrency  the central bankers wanting to establish a world government may adopt, Silver & gold if the public is convinced enough to go back to a gold standard, or oil incase the US dollar survives somehow. These three things I would diversy in, because if the other 2 fail but 1 of them goes up by value six times you've doubled your money. Alot of people do not like fiat currency, alot of people do not like socialism. </p>
		<br>
		<p>With current events this may be the smart thing to do, but take it slowly. Don't invest all of it at once, or more than you can afford. Because right now you need cash, even though it is losing its value very quickly. If there is a virus that grows at an exponential rate and you stick this virus in a cup, the cup takes an hour to fill, when is the cup half full? Most people might think thirty minutes, but at 2^2 the answer acually is the very last second. And that is what we are seeing with our current financial situation. A bubble that is about to pop and the corona virus was the needle that popped it. Whether or not people decide to fight for their financial freedom or let the people behind the scenes control policy there is a way to win for yourself. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Still have faith in the future of financial independence for the people. In the information age many people are aware about how central banks work and understand that fiat currency with debt attached and interest which is not added to the money supply creates a game of musical chairs. Causing forclosures to be innevitable, which is the way banks legally commit theft. Central banks and government officials should be conserned, unless they have no idea how much true freedom is embedded in the hearts of every American.</p>
